# data_engineering

My name is Maria Kraeva and I aspire to become a data engineer. This git is dedicated to my fist steps in this field.
Before starting this path I would like to thank Dmitriy Anoshin for creating the platform DataLearn and launching the free course "Getting Started with Analytics (Data) Engineering" that motivated me to start. I hope that recording my progress may help me stay motivated and may inspire the other people passionate about the world of data to improve their skills and share new insights to the community.
